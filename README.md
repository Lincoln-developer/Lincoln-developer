💻 Aspiring Interpreter Engineer | CPython Contributor | Passionate Python Developer

Hi there! 👋 I'm a Python developer with a deep love for interpreter design and performance optimization. My mission is to improve the internals of CPython and contribute to the performance and scalability of the Python ecosystem. 
⚡ Fun fact: I love building for other !

I specialize in:

- ⚙️ Bytecode Optimization: Streamlining bytecode for faster execution
- 🔁 Execution Loop Enhancements: Optimizing CPython’s core evaluation loop (ceval.c)
- 🚀 Performance Improvements: Exploring new opcodes and memory-efficient paths
- 📄 PEP Collaboration: Participating in Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) related to interpreter design

🌍 Career Vision
I am on a journey to:

- Make Python faster and more efficient, especially for high-performance applications
- Build deep expertise in interpreter and compiler design
- Work with global Python communities and organizations that rely on Python for developer tools, scientific computing, and backend systems
  
Currently, I am diving into "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom to refine my understanding of virtual machines, bytecode mechanics, and execution models—knowledge that I apply to my CPython contributions.

👀 Let’s Collaborate!
- I love connecting with like-minded developers passionate about Python internals and open-source contributions. If you're interested in Python's performance optimization, compiler theory, or CPython contributions, feel free to reach out!

⚡ Current Goals
- Contribute impactful optimizations to CPython for real-world applications
- Propose and collaborate on PEPs driving performance improvements
